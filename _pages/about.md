I am a fourth-year PhD student in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/) and Prof. [Tong Yang](https://yangtonghome.github.io/). 

I am broadly interested in data strucutres and algorithms (probabilistic data strucutes, hash tables, streaming algorithms), as well as their applications in various distributed systems (networked systems, machine learning systems, storage systems). 
<!-- My current research focus is using these algorithms to optimize the performance and efficiency of machine learning systems.  -->


I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/) , Peking University in 2021. 
I have been working as a research intern at Datacom Forwarding Algorithm Lab of [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/), Beijing, since Oct. 2021.

My name written in Chinese is 刘子瑞 (<b><font color="red">Tel/WeChat: (+86) 18810703566</font></b>).
